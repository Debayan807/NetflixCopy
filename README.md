Netflix Clone – Web Development Project
Project Overview
The Netflix Clone is a front-end web development project that replicates the user interface of Netflix using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and responsive streaming platform layout, showcasing various sections like featured movies, trending shows, and category-based content.

Features & Functionalities
✅ Home Page UI – A Netflix-like homepage with a hero banner, movie posters, and category rows.
✅ Responsive Design – Ensures smooth viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
✅ Hover Effects & Animations – Adds dynamic interactivity to movie thumbnails and buttons using CSS transitions.
✅ Movie Carousel – Scrollable rows of movie thumbnails using JavaScript event listeners.
✅ Navigation Bar – A fixed-top navbar with a logo, search bar, and profile section.
✅ Dark Theme – Styled with Netflix’s signature dark mode UI for an immersive experience.
✅ Interactive Buttons – Play, Add to List, and More Info buttons with hover animations.
✅ Smooth Scrolling – Implemented for a seamless browsing experience across sections.

Technologies Used
🔹 HTML – Structure of the webpage (divs, sections, and semantic elements).
🔹 CSS – Styling, layout, animations, and responsiveness.
🔹 JavaScript – Interactivity, dynamic content loading, and event handling.


Future Enhancements – Full-Stack Netflix Clone (Java Backend)
To transform the Netflix Clone into a full-stack web application, we can integrate a Java-based backend using Spring Boot, along with a relational or NoSQL database for dynamic content handling and user authentication.

1️⃣ Backend Development (Spring Boot & Java)
🔹 Framework: Spring Boot – A lightweight and efficient Java framework for building RESTful APIs.
🔹 Security: Spring Security + JWT – Secure authentication and role-based access.
🔹 API Handling: RESTful APIs – Manage movies, user authentication, subscriptions, and watchlists.
🔹 Payment Integration: Use Stripe/Razorpay for subscription-based payments.

2️⃣ Database Integration
🔹 Database Choices:
✅ MySQL/PostgreSQL – Relational database for structured data (users, subscriptions, movie metadata).
✅ MongoDB – NoSQL option for flexible movie storage and user watchlists.
✅ Redis – Caching layer for fast retrieval of frequently accessed content.

🔹 Key Database Tables/Collections:
✔️ Users: (ID, Name, Email, Password, Subscription Plan)
✔️ Movies/Shows: (ID, Title, Genre, Language, Duration, Rating)
✔️ Watchlist: (UserID, MovieID, Timestamp)
✔️ History: (UserID, MovieID, LastWatchedTimestamp)
✔️ Payments: (UserID, PlanID, Status, ExpiryDate)

3️⃣ Full-Stack Features
✅ User Authentication – Login/Signup with JWT-based authentication.
✅ User Profiles – Allow multiple profiles per account.
✅ Movie Management – Fetch and store movie data dynamically from TMDb API.
✅ Watchlist & Continue Watching – Track movies users want to watch or resume later.
✅ Admin Panel – CRUD operations for adding/removing movies.
✅ Search & Filters – Implement search functionality with filtering by genre, language, and ratings.
✅ Streaming Simulation – Embed a video player (e.g., HLS.js, Video.js) for media playback.

4️⃣ Tech Stack Overview

5️⃣ Deployment & CI/CD
🔹 Containerization: Dockerizing backend services for easy deployment.
🔹 CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions / Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.
🔹 Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for media storage.

🚀 Final Outcome
A fully functional Netflix-like streaming platform with:
✅ Secure user authentication
✅ Personalized content recommendations
✅ Watchlist & history tracking
✅ Subscription-based model
